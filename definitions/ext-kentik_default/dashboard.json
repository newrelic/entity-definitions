More additions are being added all the time and we always welcome PRs!*\n\nThe process to create an entity is as follows:\n \n 1. Data is processed by ktranslate and SysOIDs are matched to a pre-defined '[profile](https://github.com/kentik/snmp-profiles/tree/main/profiles/kentik_snmp)', which then transposes to the `provider` attribute in the data sent to New Relic. Devices with no match are set to `provider: kentik-default`.\n  2. On ingest, New Relic matches data from ktranslate based on the value of the `provider` attribute into a pre-defined entity definition. Devices where `provider: kentik-default` are synthesized in `Kentik Default` entities. *(which is what you are looking at right now)*\n\nTo remediate this, you will need to update your YAML config file for ktranslate to ensure the `mib_profile` value for this device matches a known profile. If none exist to match, you can [submit a pull request](https://github.com/kentik/snmp-profiles/compare) to ktranslate, or [open an issue](https://github.com/kentik/snmp-profiles/issues/new) if you need assistance. \n\nIf you also need a new entity type defined in New Relic, you can [submit a pull request](https://github.com/newrelic/entity-definitions/compare) to the entity definition repo, contact your New Relic account team or [ask for help in the Explorer's Hub](https://discuss.newrelic.com/c/full-stack-observability/465) and we'll be happy to assist!"
