# Relationship docs

Please note that the relationship synthesis mechanism is currently in the experimental phase.

For newcomers, we recommend starting with [relationship synthesis](../docs/relationships/relationship_synthesis.md).
This document will walk you through creating relationships using the synthesis process.

If you have experience with the repo and are looking for a specific section documentation:
- [Relationship Synthesis](../docs/relationships/relationship_synthesis.md)
- [Candidate Relationships](../docs/relationships/candidate_relationships.md)
